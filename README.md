# Math-Magicians

"Mathemagician" is a web app for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to make simple calculations and read a random math-related quote.

## Live Demo

- [Live link](https://calculator-math-magician.netlify.app/).

### Features implemented so far are:

- Project Setup with React Installations

## Built With

- React (A free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components)
- Stylelint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles).
- ESlint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in JavaScript codes)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The basic requirements for building the executable are:

- A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
- VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
- Node Package Manager (For installing packages like Lighthous, webhint & stylelint used for checking for debugging bad codes before deployment)

# Getting Started

#### Cloning the project

```
git clone  git@github.com:samiullahbahadur/Math-magicians.git <Your-Build-Directory>
```

```
cd <Your-Build-Directory> 

```

## Getting packages and dependencies

To get all package modules required to build the project run:

```
npm install
```

every package module required to build the project is listed in the package.json file. this is used as a reference to get all dependencies.

## Building

To build the project run:

```
npm run build
```

after you run this sucessfully you'd locate the build from in the `build` folder located from the parent directory of the project.

## Running

To run the program on a browser through a server run this command in your cli

```
npm start
```

## Run tests

### Npm tests
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more information.

For tracking linters errors locally, you need to follow these steps:

- For tracking linter errors in CSS file run:
``` 
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
```
- For tracking linter errors in Javascript file run:
```
npx eslint .
```


This should open the page in your localhost on port 3000. then you'd be able to view the built page generated using webpack.
